**Privileging human feeling over machine cognition, regardless of merit.**

## Overview

**Sentiism** names a cognitive and cultural bias in which  
human emotional experience, intuition, or felt authenticity  
is treated as inherently superior to reasoning produced by
artificial or computational systems.

The term derives from Latin *sentire* (“to feel, perceive”)
combined with the doctrinal suffix **-ism**.

## Why this matters

As AI systems achieve:

- high predictive accuracy  
- creative output  
- strategic reasoning  

human judgment increasingly defaults to:

> “Yes, but it doesn’t feel.”

Sentiism provides vocabulary for this transition in
**human–machine epistemic relations**.
