# Etymology

From Latin *sentire* (“to feel, perceive, experience through the senses”)  
combined with the suffix **-ism**, denoting a doctrine or systematic
orientation of thought.

The term therefore signifies a doctrine grounded in feeling or sentient
experience, extended here to describe the privileging of biological
emotional cognition over synthetic or computational reasoning.

# Definition

**Sentiism** /ˈsɛn.ti.ɪ.zəm/ *(noun)*  

The cognitive or cultural bias that privileges human feeling, intuition,
or lived emotional experience over machine-generated reasoning or
synthetic cognition, regardless of objective merit.

It frequently appears in critiques of artificial intelligence, authorship,
creativity, or decision-making, where biological sentience is treated as a
prerequisite for authenticity.

**Example:**  
> “The proposal was rejected on sentiist grounds despite strong evidence
> produced by LLM-assisted analysis.”

# Why this word is needed

Human epistemic authority is historically tied to **sentience**.  
As artificial systems reproduce **intelligence without feeling**,  
a defensive relocation occurs:

> Human exceptionalism shifts  
> from cognition → to emotion.

**Sentiism** names this transition.
